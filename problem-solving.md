## What is an Algorithm

A process or set of steps to accomplish a task

1. Understand the problem
2. Break it down
3. Solve or simplify the problem
4. Refactor

## Understand the problem

1. Restate the problem in your owns words
2. What are the inputs
3. What are the outputs
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem

## Break it down

- Write input examples
- Ask questions that crop up to get clarity
- Break it down in pseudocode before writing code

**Solve the problem, if you can't solve a simpler problem!!!**

## Solve of simplify

- Find the difficulty
- Ignore the difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate the difficulty back in

## Refactor

- Can you check results
- Can you find a different solution
- Can you improve the performance
- Can you think of other ways to refactor
- How have other people solved the problem
